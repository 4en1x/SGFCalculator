###To start this project:
 - install node `brew install node`
 - install watchman `brew install watchman`
 - React Native CLI `npm install -g react-native-cli`
 - You probably will need `XCode` and `Android Studio` to Run / Build Project
 - `cd ./folder-with-this-project`
 - `npm i`
 - `react-native link`
 - `react-native run-ios` - start emulator for ios
 - Â for example, `react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone X"` - start iPhone X emulator
 - `react-native run-android` - start emulator for android
 - you already have all XCode Settings, so you should just add your Developer Profile and click `Product -> Archive`
 - almost same with `Android Studio` - you already have all settings, just do new build
